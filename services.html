				<h2>Acupuncture</h2>
				<p>Acupuncture originate in China more than 2,500 years ago, and spread to all over the world.</p>
				<p>Acupuncture is one of the most popular complementary medicine anywhere. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, </p>
				<p>your overall health is dependent on the free flow of the Qi (energy) through the natural pathways of your body (meridians). </p>
				<p>Acupuncture uses a variety of techniques to stimulate and improve your Qi flow to restore your health.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="electro">
				<h2>Electro-Acupuncture</h2>
				<p>Electro-acupuncture is a great improvement of traditional acupuncture. In practice, it is actually very similar to traditional</p>
				<p> acupuncture. After inserting needles into specific points along the meridians of your body, I then attach the needles to a device that  </p>
				<p>delivers gentle electrical pulses between two points. This helps De-Qi and Qi arriving to the ill area to restore the free flow of Qi </p>
				<p>through your body, removing any blockages and clearing out stagnation in the meridian.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="moxibustion">
				<h2>Moxibustion</h2>
				<p>Moxibustion that involves the burning of mugwort, has been used for healing purposes for thousands of years. The purpose of moxibustion,</p>
				<p> as with most forms of Traditional Chinese Medicine, is to strengthen the blood, stimulate the flow of Qi, and enhance your overall health.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="acupressure">
				<h2>Acupressure</h2>
				<p>Acupressure is based on one the most ancient principles of healing - that simply touching a specific point on the body will release </p>
				<p>stress and improve health in the body. In an acupressure session, I apply firm pressure directly to these "points" on your body, </p>
				<p>which relieves your muscle tension and improves your circulation. This simple and powerful technique has been shown to very effective </p>
				<p>in treating headaches, backaches, and even insomnia.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="herbal">
				<h2>Chinese Herbal Medicine</h2>
				<p>Chinese Herbal Medicine uses a wide variety of substances and therapeutic modalities such as Plant, animal and mineral substances. </p>
				<p>The most common methods of applying herb therapies are to make a decoction, extracted powders, and patent medicine (tablets or capsules).</p>
				<p>In most cases, I will prescribe a specific formulation for an individual patient, which might be modified over a </p>
				<p>course of treatment. Sometimes you can take patent medicine for convenience. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="tui-na">
				<h2>Tui-Na</h2>
				<p>Chinese Tui Na is commonly used for musculoskeletal conditions. It is a Chinese style of massage, using various massage techniques </p>
				<p>including kneading, pressing, rolling, shaking, and stretching the body to restore the functions of tendons, bones and joints. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="other">
				<h2>Ear Seeds</h2>
				<p>Ear seeds are small seeds or beads used to stimulate the acupuncture points located within the ear.</p>
				<h2>Cupping</h2>
				<p>Suction stimulation, applied to draw out "evil pathogens" from the body and to improve the free flow of qi.</p>
				<h2>Qi Gong</h2>
				<p>Qi Gong is the practice of integrating breath, body, and mind so as to enrich and coordinate the functions of essence, energy, and spirit to enhance vitality and prevent disease.</p>
